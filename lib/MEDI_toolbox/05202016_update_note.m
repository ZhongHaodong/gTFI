% This is an updated version of MEDI toolbox.
% 
Minor changes:

1. Read_Siemens_DICOM has been updated to handle situations where number of echoes reported in DICOM header (.EchoTrainLength) is not correct.

Note: since the new function uses additional files which might potentially be a source of compatibility issues between different versions of Matlab, old function is still included in the toolbox as "Read_Siemens_DICOM_old".
